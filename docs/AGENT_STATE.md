# ETNARA Agent State

## Current Status

Project: ETNARA Care
Repository: ETNARA-Backend
Branch: codex/fix-cross-portal-security

## Current Backend Checkpoint

The recovered backend work is implemented, reviewed, and published in draft PR #3:

- migrations 038/039
- messaging auto-participant fix
- idempotent participant backfill
- notifications for care events
- notifications for incidents
- family-safe curated endpoints for observations
- family-safe curated endpoints for incidents
- family-safe curated endpoints for shifts / check-in / check-out
- security fix blocking Family from raw / uncurated endpoints
- regression testing for Family data leakage

Additional corrections completed:

- Family access requires an active FAMILY membership.
- Family observations are limited to reviewed records.
- Failed migrations roll back and are not marked as applied.
- Migration execution is protected by an advisory lock.
- The demo password is supplied through `DEMO_PASSWORD`, never source code.
- Local build, 9 tests, and npm audit pass.
- GitHub CI passed on the published backend commit.

## Mandatory Next Step

PostgreSQL 16 validation now passes: all migrations install from an empty
database and a second bootstrap completes idempotently. Obtain explicit approval
before merging PR #3 and deploying it to Railway.

## Current Product Priority

Establish reliable real-data connectivity between:

- Caregiver / Worker
- Family
- Administration

Priority order:

1. Messaging
2. Administration real data
3. Care timeline / care events
4. Shifts / check-in / check-out
5. Notifications
6. Family-safe observations / incidents

## Deployment Notes

Backend staging is deployed on Railway.

Frontend is deployed through GitHub Pages.

Verify actual deployment configuration before changing deployment behavior.
